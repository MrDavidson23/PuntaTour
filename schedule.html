          Hi there! We hope you are enjoying our website as we do. This page is
          going to help you choose the best tour option for you. This is how it
          works: we give you some options with the main attractions and their
          details like eating schedule, time of departure and tour duration. The
          only thing you have to do is select wisely the one that you like the
          most.

              -Option 1: If you don’t mind getting up early, this would be a
              great option.

            <p>
              At 7:00 am is your appointment for a nutritious breakfast at a
              famous restaurant in the center of Puntarenas. Then, at 8:00 am
              our bus is going to take you to Jaco Beach. There, you are not
              going to lay on the sand only, but also experience different
              aquatic activities. You are going to have lunch at 2:00 pm, but
              don’t worry we are going to give you snacks in the meantime. At
              3:00 pm our bus is going to take you to Montezuma’s Waterfalls.
              You will be back around 7:00 pm.

            <p>
              At 8:00 am you are going to have breakfast in a restaurant with a
              beautiful view to the Pacific Ocean. At 9:00 am our bus is going
              to take to Manuel Antonio National Park. There, an experienced
              guide will explain everything to you. You are going to eat in the
              park at 2:30 pm and leave at 6:00 pm in our bus. *In our last tour
              we were going to visit Jaco Beach too, but we experienced some
              delays because the National Park have many activities included,
              that’s why the option 2 looks shorter.
